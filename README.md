# About, what we do

This is the project repository of the Plone Admin Team.  (Formerly known as AI-team). The main use for this repository is using issues Project Board to plan, document and communicate with the community teams that require our services. 

The Admin team manages the servers, SAAS-platforms, several websites, CI/CD infrastructure and other mostly web applications that the Plone Foundation uses to develop, support and spread the word about Plone, an Open Source Content Management system written in Python and Javascript. 

For many of website and tools we are the backup, both literally and figuratively. We try to delegate as much as day to day management as possible to the community teams and release managers who use these platforms and tools. We maintain extra (admin-)-accounts, update the servers and applications, are standby for outages, security incidentsm, etc. etc. A sub-group of our team is maintaining the Plone CI/CD systems. 

Please be aware we are only a small team of senior Plonista's with experience ranging from sysadnin/devops/development to project management, and are likely  also active in other Teams. We are gratefull to support the Plone Foundation with our expertise, but our resources, mostly time, are limited, so we try to automate as much as possible. 

# Security incidents and reports

If you find any security isuse you would like to report about the Plone CMS Appliation itself

-> please send an e-mail to the Security Team: security@plone.org. https://plone.org/community/teams/security

If you (for example as a developer) experience a security incident, like your GitHub account credentials, or Personal Access Token getting hacked, or you notice anything strange in general with th Plone Foundation websites or SAAS-platforms we use:

-> please also notify admins@plone.org, so we can respond as quickly as possible.

Thank you for your thoughful disclosure. 

# Joining the Admin-Team

We are always looking for more people to help us with the above described tasks. At the same time, this is not the most suitable team for junior/apprenatice members of the Plone Community, considering both the knowledge required and the sensitivy and possible implications of mistakes of some of our tasks. If you have (verifiable) experience with DevOps, Technical Project Management, Container based Deployment, CI/CD, and Plone Development on a medior to senior level, and have some time (8+ hours) each month to spare as a volunteer, please contact us.
